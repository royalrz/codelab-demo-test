## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. Use [Object Mapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-mapper) to make `src/tasks/upwork.spec.ts` pass
3. `npm run test` should pass

Don't fork or push changes remotely, instead please send me the spec file over Upwork chat so other developers don't see it.
